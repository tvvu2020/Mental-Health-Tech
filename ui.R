                to the CDC, 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. reported having mental illness in 2016. Mental disorders such
                as depression are linked to higher rates of disibility and unemployment. In fact, "depression
                interferes with a personâ€™s ability to complete physical job tasks about 20% of the time and reduces
                cognitive performance about 35% of the time." Globally, according to the WHO, about 264 million 
                people suffer from depression. WHO led a study on mental health in the workplace, and discovered that 
                depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy one trillion U.S. dollars each year in lost
                productivity. There is a good chance that you may know someone affected with mental health disorders in the
                workplace. However, due to the stigma associated with mental health issues, individuals may choose to
                keep their personal challenges to themselves, and thus, they may not seek the help they need. The CDC and WHO
                encourage employers to promote mental health awareness and provide employees with support and resources such
                as low or no cost medical benefits for mental health counseling.',
