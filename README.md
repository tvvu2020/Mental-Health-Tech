# Mental-Health-Tech

Mental health disorders are one of the most burdensome health concerns in the United States. According to the CDC, 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. reported having mental illness in 2016. Mental disorders such as depression are linked to higher rates of disibility and unemployment. The WHO led a study on mental health in the workplace, and discovered that depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy one trillion U.S. dollars each year in lost productivity. The CDC and WHO encourage employers to promote mental health awareness and provide employees with support and resources such as low or no cost medical benefits for mental health counseling.

Considering that the tech industry is known to offer great employee benefits and support, I chose a dataset from the Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) Mental Health in Tech Survey 2016 to analyze how the tech industry deal with mental health issues in the workplace.

This app was designed to allow you to visualize and answer the following questions regarding mental health in the tech industry: Do they talk openly about mental health in the workplace? Do they provide the necessary resources that may help their employees understand mental health disorders, and how their employees can find help and support? Do they provide medical benefits for mental health disorders? Do they take mental health as seriously as physical health?

Employer Support: this tab allows you to visualize how the tech industry responds to mental health issues in the workplace.

Survey Questions, Survey Questions By Age, Survey Questions By Country, and Survey Questions By Company Size: are tabs that allow you to visualize how certain group of respondents deal with their mental health issues in the workplace.
